Here are some suggestions:
Spelling: 
- Change reelvant spell to relevant
- change regressoion to regression
- change Dashabord to dashboard
- change masted to mastered

Content:
- As a Data Specialist, is there more than one Shiny platform to build a dashboard? Or is it just in R Shiny? 
- As a Data Scientist, what machine are you training? 
- I would change the used to implemented. I also really like the structure of this bullet point. 
- I would change problem shooting to troubleshooting
